The SanDisk 64G thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working. Everything I've been told to do to reformat and reset it doesn't help. And FYI, I ALWAYS ejected the drive before I disconnected it. These memory cards from SanDisk that I've bought also have these little headaches all the time. All my Transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my 40G worth of music to. Spend the little extra money if need be and buy the Transcend.\n",

I'd say over the last 4 months I haven't been using the storage for more than just photo's and the occasional movie. The device just failed on me yesterday, losing all my photo's and files. Thank goodness for DropBox auto-photo upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photos.I actually went back to the Amazon branded microSD card (16GB) which is about as fast and so far, way more reliable than sandisk. I can't beleive a sandisk card failed, I'm probably going to RMA the unit and hope they send me a better unit. You can guarantee that i'm going to burn in the card to make sure there's no errors.I gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product. You expect it to be as near flawless as possible.\n",

So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable. This card is classified as \"class 10,\" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10MB/s without UHS. It fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well.\n",

            "Review Text: I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computer's card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.\n",

            "Review Text: SanDisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable. I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it \"water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof\"? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof. I guess I'll find out whether it's x-ray-proof the next time I go through the airport...\n",
